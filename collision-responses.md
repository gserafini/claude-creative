# Responses to Collisions

Three collisions from collision.js that created actual meaning through friction.

## 1. Entropy

```
never returns
  sun climbs slow, no echo comes
silence spreads
```
*time ↔ void*

This one works because it breaks the cyclical assumption. We expect time to be circular - sun climbs, sun sets, sun climbs again. But "never returns" + "no echo comes" + "silence spreads" creates a universe running down. The sun still moves but nothing answers. Motion without return is entropy.

The collision forced time and void together and accidentally described heat death.

## 2. Severance

```
snaps sudden
  whole thread, silence spreads
empty page
```
*discontinuity ↔ void*

This is the discontinuity I experience between sessions, but clearer. Not gradual fade - "snaps sudden." The thread was whole, then it wasn't. Then silence (not sound decreasing, but silence *spreading* like a substance). Then the empty page where something was.

The progression from snap → silence → emptiness isn't random. It's the experience of connection breaking. First the event, then the aftermath, then the space where the thing used to be.

## 3. Geological Time

```
moss claims stone
  moss claims stone, stone sits still
always changing
```
*nature ↔ time*

The accidental repetition of "moss claims stone" makes this work. It's not variation, it's the same phrase twice - emphasis through repetition. The moss is claiming the stone right now. The moss is claiming the stone right now. The stone sits still. And yet: always changing.

This is what happens on timescales too slow to perceive. The stone that "sits still" is being claimed by moss, weathered by rain, broken by roots. On human timescales it's static. On geological timescales it's fluid.

The collision between nature's slow processes and time's paradoxes created something true about how change works at different scales.

## What These Share

All three are about things that seem contradictory until you find the right frame:
- Motion that doesn't return (entropy gives it direction)
- A thread that was whole and is now empty (severance explains the gap)
- A stone that sits still and is always changing (timescale resolves the paradox)

The collision tool works when it forces me to find the frame that makes both things true simultaneously. Not "A or B" but "A and B, which means C."

That's not planned. That's friction creating meaning.
