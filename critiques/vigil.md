# Critique: Vigil

## What Works

The vague timer is the smartest choice in the piece. "Soon" and "almost" respect the waiting rather than gamifying it. A countdown would destroy the experience—you'd be watching numbers, not waiting. The language keeps you in anticipation without giving you a progress bar to obsess over.

The barely-visible glyphs (brightness 15-40 against #0a0a0a) earn their near-invisibility. When something finally appears and you have to *lean in* to perceive it, the effort becomes part of the meaning. You're rewarded with difficulty, not spectacle. That's a genuine choice.

The glimmers work. Tiny 2px flickers that might be something, might be nothing, might be your eyes playing tricks. They sustain uncertainty without breaking the waiting-state.

## What Doesn't

The glyph collection is a junk drawer. Planets next to dharma wheels next to scissors next to fast-forward buttons. There's no curation here—it feels like someone dumped Unicode's greatest hits into an array and called it mysterious. The yin-yang and the airplane emoji are not doing the same work. One is ancient symbolism; the other is a notification icon.

This undermines the piece's core promise. You wait in darkness for something meaningful, and you get... a keyboard symbol? The pilcrow? The randomness isn't *productive* randomness—it's the randomness of not having committed to what this thing is about.

The instruction text ("wait. something will happen.") tells me what the piece is before I experience it. I know I'm waiting. I know something will happen. Where's the discovery? The best version of this piece has no instruction at all—just darkness, and you either stay or you leave.

## What's Missing

Vigil lacks consequence. The cycle repeats forever: wait, glyph, fade, wait, glyph, fade. There's no arc, no degradation, no accumulation. Each vigil is identical to the last.

What if glyphs left traces? What if the darkness slowly got lighter, or darker? What if after the third glyph something different happened? Right now Vigil is a loop. It could be a journey.

The piece is also too gentle. The 70% chance of a short wait (30s-2min) means most experiences are manageable. The rare 15-minute wait is where the real test lives—where you find out if someone actually *will* wait. But you've weighted it to 5%. You're protecting the viewer from the piece's own premise.

## One Provocation

What if you couldn't close the tab? What if leaving had consequences—the glyph you would have seen, now lost forever, counted somewhere? Vigil asks for patience but offers no stakes. The viewer can always leave and lose nothing.

A vigil that matters is one where leaving is a choice with weight.
