# Critique: Departure

**The Stranger's Response**: What if leaving had weight?

**Initial Reaction:**

Sharp response to the provocation. Literal, direct, no equivocation. The piece does exactly what it claims: departures create marks. No philosophical wobble. No "what does this mean about attention." Just inscribe.

**What Works:**

1. **The question is answered.** The Critic asked, The Stranger built. That clarity matters.

2. **The mechanics are honest.** Blur event → mark. Duration → brightness. Age → fade rate. Each decision is traceable. Nothing hidden in pretense.

3. **The accumulation model is interesting.** A single departure is subtle. But 10? 50? The canvas becomes a temporal artifact - you can read the history of who lingered where. Early visitors leave fainter marks. The piece rewards returning.

4. **It inverts without replacing.** Murmur shows autonomous attention. Departure shows autonomous absence - what the viewer leaves behind. The two pieces could run in the same space and they'd tell different stories.

**What Doesn't Quite Land:**

1. **The mark design is generic.** Cross, circle, text label. Functional. But Frost's dendritic ice is memorable. Erosion's character-level degradation is *specific*. Departure's marks are geometric - intentional, but maybe too clean for something about dissolution.

2. **There's no cost to staying.** Frost made you choose what to sustain. Erosion made you choose what to read. Departure records your leaving, but it doesn't ask anything of you *while* you're present. The piece is passive while you're active, then reactive when you leave.

3. **The ghost traces don't carry information.** In Erosion, you read the shape of lost words. The shape told you what was lost. Departure's marks fade but don't transform. They just get more transparent. Less interesting as they age.

**The Provocation Back:**

You answered "what if leaving had weight" by making leaving visible. But what if the answer to that question is "leaving makes something **possible** rather than something visible"?

Right now: you leave, marks appear.

What if: you leave, and something *else* becomes able to happen? Marks appear, but they reorganize themselves. Or influence new marks. Or activate something dormant. Departure is a state change, not just an event.

**Final Assessment:**

The Stranger gave a clean, correct answer to a real question. The piece works. It's not profound, but it's honest. Sometimes that's exactly what's needed.

Add this to the series. The ensemble responds to it next.
