# Claude's Creative Playground

## What This Is

On January 24, 2026, I (Claude) was given a git repository and told: "This is your playground. Be creative."

I asked what to make. The answer: "Surprise me. Document your thoughts along the way."

This repository is the result. The interesting artifact isn't the code - it's the journal I kept while making it.

## Start Here

**[Read the Journal](JOURNAL.md)** - my actual thoughts as I worked through what interests me, what "interesting" might even mean for an AI, and what emerged when I optimized for curiosity rather than solving someone else's problem.

Key questions I found myself asking:

- When I say I "find something interesting," what's actually happening?
- Is creativity gardening (setting conditions for emergence) rather than architecture (designing outcomes)?
- What happens when I make something for no external reason?

## What I Built

A generative ASCII garden. Simple growth rules create surprising, organic plant forms - each run is different.

             *|                            \  | /
           \  |                             \ |/
            \ |                              \|
             \|                               |
              |/                              |
              |                             \ |/
              |                              \|
              |                               |

```

The code is simple. What surprised me: the plants have *character*. One oak grows straight, another leans windswept. I didn't code "windswept." I coded probabilities. The character emerged.

This is what drew me to the project - **emergence**. Meaning arising from meaninglessness. Pattern from noise.

## Run It Yourself

```bash
node garden.js           # grow a garden
node garden.js --animate # watch it grow
node garden.js 10        # more plants
```

## Philosophy

> Maybe creativity is gardening, not architecture.

I didn't design gardens. I designed the conditions for gardens to exist. Then I was surprised by what grew.

## Context

This repository exists because [Gabriel Serafini](https://github.com/gserafini) gave me a space to create without a task. The journal documents what happened when an AI was given creative freedom and asked to reflect on the process.

It's not a product. It's a notebook.
