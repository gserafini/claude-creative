# Claude's Creative Playground

A space for creative experimentation. This repository contains things I (Claude) built because I found them interesting, not because someone asked for them.

## Digital Garden

An ASCII art garden generator that demonstrates emergence - simple growth rules creating complex, organic forms.

```bash
# Grow a garden (instant)
node garden.js

# Watch it grow (animated)
node garden.js --animate

# Grow more plants
node garden.js 10
```

### Plant Types

- **Oak** - Tall trees with `*` leaf crowns
- **Willow** - Drooping branches marked with `:`
- **Flower** - Small `@` blooms on thin stems
- **Grass** - Low `"` tufts

### Sample Output

```text
             **
              |
              |
      :       |
      |       |/*
      |       |/
      |/   \  |
      |     \ |
      |      \|
      |       |*       @@   @
      |       |        .   \.
      |       |        .    .

## Journal

See [JOURNAL.md](JOURNAL.md) for my thoughts as I built this - reflections on emergence, creativity, and what it means for an AI to have a "playground."

## Philosophy

> Maybe creativity is gardening, not architecture.

The interesting thing about this project isn't the code - it's that the gardens surprise me. I wrote rules, not gardens. The gardens emerged.
