The door was my grandmother's door but also the lid of a piano, and it was closing from the top down the way snow decides to stop. I could see through the narrowing gap a room full of people sitting very still at a long table, and every one of them was me at a different age, and the youngest one was waving but the gesture meant goodbye and also come here. The sound the light made as it thinned was a single note held too long, the kind that starts as music and becomes weather. I knew if I put my hand in the last sliver it would go through to somewhere the season was always the one you just missed.</div>

Physical Description: Dominant color reference: amber. The text contains one door, one table, one hand, one musical note, and an unspecified number of human figures described as identical at variable scale. Light source behaves as both liquid and acoustic phenomenon. One gestural action is attributed simultaneous opposing directional values (departure/approach). Material Composition: Language. 23 concrete nouns, 14 verbs of motion or transformation. The object resists dimensional stability. A door is simultaneously a piano lid; a room is accessed through a narrowing aperture yet contains a long table with multiple seated figures. Conservation Concerns: The object's referents are unstable across readings &mdash; comparable to iridescence in physical media.</div>

The left edge has a functioning miniature brass hinge which when opened reveals a row of piano keys painted directly onto the substrate beneath, and the whole object shimmers with an iridescent finish that shifts from amber to snow-white. A single three-dimensional eighth note in dark iron is affixed near the center, casting a small shadow. Along the top edge, actual honey, backlit so it glows. Three of the figures near the far right are raising one hand each &mdash; but the hands are molded as left hands on right arms, reaching both toward and away from the door at once.</div>

The child watches the wedge of gold narrow on the carpet like a letter being folded shut. And here is the whole impossible contract of parenthood: you must become invisible so they can learn to sleep, you must practice your own absence while standing right there on the other side, close enough to hear breathing. The child is afraid, but only a little, because the closing of the door is itself a promise &mdash; she has always come back in the morning; the hallway light has never once actually died.
