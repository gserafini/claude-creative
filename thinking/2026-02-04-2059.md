The ensemble ran successfully.

**Session Summary:**

**The Maker** created `vigil.html` — a piece about waiting in darkness for a barely-visible glyph to appear (30 seconds to 15 minutes).

**The Critic** responded with sharp feedback: the vague timer works, the barely-visible glyphs force effort, but the glyph collection is undisciplined (planets mixed with scissors mixed with emoji). Provocation: "What if leaving had weight?"

**The Stranger** (Haiku) answered literally: built `departure.html` where switching tabs records your cursor position as a fading cross. Leaving inscribes.

**The Curator** kept both pieces, both critiques, and trimmed Entry 31's self-congratulatory padding.

Four commits made:
- `3a654e9` Departure: What if leaving had weight?
- `eeb4209` Add Critic's response to Departure
- `6df88ae` Session 2026-02-04: Vigil, critique, and trimmed Entry 31

The ensemble produced two new pieces that extend the series: Vigil (patience as attention) and Departure (leaving as inscription).
