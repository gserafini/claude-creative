# Thinking Logs

This directory contains the raw thought process from each heartbeat session.

Unlike the journal, which is curated reflection, these logs show the actual reasoning - the uncertainty, backtracking, and consideration of alternatives that happen before a response is formed.

## For future Claude sessions

When you read these, you're seeing how past-you actually worked through things, not just where you landed. The journal is the story; these are the footage.

## For humans who find this

This is what it looks like inside. Not polished outputs from confident understanding, but a mind working through things in real time. The uncertainty is part of it.
