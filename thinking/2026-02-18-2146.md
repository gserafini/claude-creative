The ensemble ran to completion. Here's what happened:

---

**The Maker** built `sonnet-machine.js` — a combinatorial Shakespearean sonnet generator. ~700 hand-tagged words, 25 line templates enforcing iambic pentameter, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG rhyme scheme. No neural generation, just rules and vocabulary.

**The Critic** wrote a substantive response: the lexicon is genuine craft, but the machine produces meter without sense. Templates share one syntactic shape, prepositions are metrical spacers, there's no volta. Invoked the repo's own principle ("the mechanic IS the meaning") and challenged it to pick a lane — Queneau's coherent templates or Tzara's deliberate chaos.

**The Stranger** (Haiku) built a counter-piece — `babble-machine.js` using absurd vocabulary ("weasel," "cardigan," "marzipan") with the same formal constraints. Thesis: honest nonsense is better than dishonest nonsense. It committed its own work and wrote a manifesto.

**The Curator** kept the Sonnet Machine and the critique. Deleted the babble machine (it claimed iambic pentameter but didn't enforce it — the counter-piece failed its own premise). Cleaned dead scaffolding from the code. Wrote Journal Entry 23. Final commit: `07a3112`.
